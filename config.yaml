CDR GENERATION:
  DATA DENSITY: 10                              # Average number of CDR per day per user
  POPULATION: {"User": 0, "GeneralUser": 100}
  TIME PERIOD: ['2021-01-01', '2021-01-01']     # Date period for which to calculate synthetic CDR, both sides inclusive
  DAY ACTIVITY MEAN: {0: 0.771, 1: 0.685, 2: 0.702,               # Average activity coefficients for days of the week
                      3: 0.769, 4: 0.953, 5: 0.329,               # 0 by default meaning Monday, 1 = Tuesday etc
                      6: 0.073}
  DAY ACTIVITY STANDARD DEVIATION: {0: 0.079, 1: 0.095, 2: 0.063, # Average activity coefficient deviations for days of the week
                                    3: 0.069, 4: 0.052, 5: 0.074, # 0 by default meaning Monday, 1 = Tuesday etc  
                                    6: 0.050}
  DAY PROBABILITY: 0.98                         # Probability that a CDR happens not during the night (00:00 - 06:00). Could be fine-tuned
  WEEKEND ARRAY: {"Saturday", "Sunday"}

REFERENCE:
  CELLS: 'ref_data/ee_cells.csv'                # Input data in the form of cells, usually from OpenCellID. Uses the columns 'cell', 'lat' and 'lon'
  # TODO: Make custom column formats somehow acceptable

OUTPUT:
  CDR: 'output_files/cdr_files'                 # Output folder for synthetic CDR data
  CELLS: 'output_files/cell_location_files'     # Output folder for cell location files
  METADATA: 'output_files/metadata_files'       # Output folder for synthetic CDR metadata (users, profiles and meaningful locations)
